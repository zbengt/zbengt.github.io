### June 23

-   Finish run through of Ptuh lncRNA discovery pipeline with GFFcompare edits. Altered GTF formatting code. Confirmed final files do not have duplicates. [Link to notebook post.](https://zbengt.github.io/2025-06-23-Ptuh_pipeline_full_explanation/)
-   Summarize the projects and findings from FISH 460 lab experiments. [Link to notebook post.](https://zbengt.github.io/2025-06-23-FISH460_crab_ecophysiology_projects/)
-   Set-up summer daily notebook post.

### June 24

-   Annual review and summer planning meeting with Steven
-   Set-up hack-a-thon for this week
-   Figured out why 0 counts across all samples for given lncRNAs in deep-dive-expression matrices by altering FeatureCounts settings. [Link to notebook post.](https://zbengt.github.io/2025-06-23-Summer_zero_counts_lncRNA/)

### June 25

-   Hack-a-thon
-   Re-run FeatureCounts code for Ptuh lncRNAs to confirms setting changes will add counts to 0 count rows. Create lab notebook post and github issue response for this problem. [Link to notebook post.](#0)
-   Fixed hack-a-thon conferencing
-   Set-up new Pearson's correlation code for revised lncRNA count matrices
