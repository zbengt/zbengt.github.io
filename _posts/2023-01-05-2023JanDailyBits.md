### Jan 4
* First day of environmental data science course (FISH 549), went over course expectations, overview, and data science principles
* Worked on first committee meeting slides â€“ used GSS lightning talk slides as a jumping off point. Mussel work is pretty easy and almost set for final analysis. Long non-coding RNA work is a little harder to nail down.
* Troubleshooting lab notebook (unsuccessful)

### Jan 5
* Lab meeting and pub-a-thon
* Met with Steven to discuss first committee meeting
  * Need to focus on the story and add some additional context, each chapter adds a      layer of complexity, should add additional info on bypass and additional chapter
* Finishing up first draft of committee meeting slides, send to Steven when complete
* Steven helped me fix lab notebook

### Jan 6
* Environmental data science class
* Finished draft first committee meeting slides, sent to Steven for review
* Practiced presentation for committee meeting

### Jan 9
* Incorporated Steven's edits for committee meeting slides
* 1st committee meeting (need to do a quick write up from my written notes in notebook)
* SAFS Cafe
* Had chat with Sarah Tanja about lab notebooks and elicit.org for lit reviews
* CoEnv strategic planning meeting

### Jan 10
* Catch up on Environmental Data Science class I missed yesterday for committee meeting, covered "research compendia" which is already very similar to how we organize repos in the Roberts lab, also started this week's homework

Compendium general structure:

* Working on lab notebook post of updates from first committee meeting

### Jan 11
* FISH 549 class, intro to git
  * Really feels like an extended software carpentry workshop, homework for this
  week is essentially working with git in command line and then setting up a 
  project repo
* Worked on my methods section for pub-a-thon tomorrow

### Jan 12
* Pub-a-thon
* Worked on the methods section of mussel heat stress paper, at the vomitting on the page stage, need to get in an edit
* Finished lab notebook post with committee meeting updates
  * TLDR: Basically re-working second chapter to work with coral data Hollie     
  mentioned in meeting. She brought up the great point of making sure my chosen 
  data set actually works for seeing environmental responsiveness in lncRNAs. New 
  tentative timeline reflects focusing on wrapping up mussel work and continuing to
  re-work second chapter, with the overall intent of applying for by-pass by the 
  end of this summer (by the end of spring ideally).
* Bevan Seminar with William Cheung from UBC Ocean and Fisheries
  
### Jan 13
* Environmental Data Science class, working with git in command line
* Realized in class that I need to do an Xcode update, but I don't have the space on my computer. Using this as an opportunity to clean up my computer, do some organization, and delete old files. Need to make sure I won't have any issues working in command line.

### Jan 15
* Worked with Zoe over the weekend and set up my to-do for this week (17th-20th). List is in [this post](https://zbengt.github.io/2023-01-15-Weekof17-To-Do/).

### Jan 17
* Lab meeting, Rosalind had us think about possible lessons we would be comfortable teaching
  * Seems like this could turn into some cool field invasives stuff, and I could       always develop a lesson plan for coastal remote sensing
* Hit a wall in using command line git, need to update Xcode
  * My computer storage is out of hand, can't update until I get this under control
* Spent a lot of today organizing and moving files around (a clean up that was       longer overdue)

### Jan 18
* Environmental data science class, we're working in R using Git version control
  * Confirmed with Mark that Xcode was holding me up, he recommended trying to just   update command line tools
* Spent a little too much time trying to figure out how to parse out certain parts   of the Xcode update to no avail
* Deleted a ton of system files and documents I don't need, still needed more space   so I got an SD card and moved a ton of files over
* Successfully updated Xcode which fixed my Git command line and R Studio issues
  * Also decluttered my computer a lot
  * Definitely was a case for using Raven, but nice to have everything all set up      on my personal computer

### Jan 19
* PSD lunch
* Chat with prospective grad students about the Roberts Lab
* Bevan Seminar and TGIT
  * Presenter - Marco Hatch
  * Nice conceptual framework for working with indigenous communities, really          focused on boundary spanners (those who have a relationship with a community       and work with western scientists)

### Jan 20
* Environmental data science class
  * Did homework, simple repo creation exercise
* Spoke with my previous advisor at NASA, Juan Torres-Perez
  * We discussed a lot of different ways to get at examining how the environment      impacts corals. Discussed looking further into symbiont relationships and         examining UV as an important environmental consideration. We also discussed       adding him to my committee which I think would be an amazing addition from an     environmental and coral knowledge base perspective.
  * Important potential contacts mentioned during our conversation:
      * (Anastazia Banaszak)[https://unam.academia.edu/ABanaszak], UNAM (solar            radiation impacts on corals and reef ecology)
      * (Howard Lasker)[https://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/geology/faculty-staff/fa         culty/howard-lasker.html], University of Buffalo
      * (Mary Alice Coffroth)[https://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/geology/faculty-st         aff/faculty/mary-alice-coffroth.html], University of Buffalo (symbiont            relationships)

### Jan 23-28
* I was super sick this week, so didn't get too much done...
* Need to reschedule qPCR with Grace, we were both out sick wednesday
* Attended a SAC meeting where we discussed tuition increases and more about the    budget, probably worth bringing up to FINS
* E5 Molecular Mechanism meeting, we discussed how we get from epigenetic state to   environment and what metrics we could be assessing from a molecular perspective   to get at this aim.
    * Set up a meeting with Jill Ashey (Putnam lab grad student) to discuss our         projects on non-coding RNA.
    * Bow-tie model of what we're trying to get at has epigentics/molecular             mechanisms on one side, environmental factors on the other side, and              physiology in the middle.
