### Jan 4
* First day of environmental data science course (FISH 549), went over course expectations, overview, and data science principles
* Worked on first committee meeting slides â€“ used GSS lightning talk slides as a jumping off point. Mussel work is pretty easy and almost set for final analysis. Long non-coding RNA work is a little harder to nail down.
* Troubleshooting lab notebook (unsuccessful)

### Jan 5
* Lab meeting and pub-a-thon
* Met with Steven to discuss first committee meeting
  * Need to focus on the story and add some additional context, each chapter adds a      layer of complexity, should add additional info on bypass and additional chapter
* Finishing up first draft of committee meeting slides, send to Steven when complete
* Steven helped me fix lab notebook

### Jan 6
* Environmental data science class
* Finished draft first committee meeting slides, sent to Steven for review
* Practiced presentation for committee meeting

### Jan 9
* Incorporated Steven's edits for committee meeting slides
* 1st committee meeting (need to do a quick write up from my written notes in notebook)
* SAFS Cafe
* Had chat with Sarah Tanja about lab notebooks and elicit.org for lit reviews
* CoEnv strategic planning meeting

### Jan 10
* Catch up on Environmental Data Science class I missed yesterday for committee meeting, covered "research compendia" which is already very similar to how we organize repos in the Roberts lab, also started this week's homework

Compendium general structure:

* Working on lab notebook post of updates from first committee meeting

### Jan 11
* FISH 549 class, intro to git
  * Really feels like an extended software carpentry workshop, homework for this
  week is essentially working with git in command line and then setting up a 
  project repo
* Worked on my methods section for pub-a-thon tomorrow

### Jan 12
* Pub-a-thon
* Worked on the methods section of mussel heat stress paper, at the vomitting on the page stage, need to get in an edit
* Finished lab notebook post with committee meeting updates
  * TLDR: Basically re-working second chapter to work with coral data Hollie     
  mentioned in meeting. She brought up the great point of making sure my chosen 
  data set actually works for seeing environmental responsiveness in lncRNAs. New 
  tentative timeline reflects focusing on wrapping up mussel work and continuing to
  re-work second chapter, with the overall intent of applying for by-pass by the 
  end of this summer (by the end of spring ideally).
* Bevan Seminar with William Cheung from UBC Ocean and Fisheries
  
### Jan 13
* Environmental Data Science class, working with git in command line
* Realized in class that I need to do an Xcode update, but I don't have the space on my computer. Using this as an opportunity to clean up my computer, do some organization, and delete old files. Need to make sure I won't have any issues working in command line.
