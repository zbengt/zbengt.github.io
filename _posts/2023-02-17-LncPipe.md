What's working for me here is the install and configuration instructions. I inspected Raven to see if nextflow is already installed and it was not to my knowledge. I'm just going to start the lncPipe from the very beginning at installation.

```sh
# Make sure that Java v8+ is installed:
java -version

# Install Nextflow
curl -fsSL get.nextflow.io | bash

# Add Nextflow binary to your PATH:
mv nextflow ~/bin/
# OR system-wide installation:
# sudo mv nextflow /usr/local/bin
```
