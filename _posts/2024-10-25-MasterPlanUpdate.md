Revisiting master plan of what the next year looks like. Featuring thoughts for final chapter plan, proposal and bypass timeline, as well as target funding opportunities.

# November (FISH 250 TA)

### Scheduling committee meeting in January/February
* Moving this from the originally projected Nov/Dec plan to give me enough time to write masters proposal (first 2 chapters for bypass proposal)

### Masters proposal
* Significant progress on masters proposal. My first two chapters are Eastern oyster + OA lncRNAs and a synthesis of coral lncRNA work from E5 descriptive and expression manuscripts.

### Olympia Oyster Work Planning
* Solidify plans with Mac on how Winter quarter work will go. Emphasize chapter worthy work and potential for LC-WGS with $5000 SAFS research grant. Continue working with Evelyn on currently available RADSeq data.

### Eastern oyster + OA lncRNAs chapter
* Finish final analyses (summarize blast results and complete WGCNA).

# December (FISH 250 TA)

### Masters proposal
* Complete masters proposal by mid December and send out to committee so they have enough time to review before next committee meeting

### Status and Bypass Plan Slides
* Prep slides for committee meeting. This will include the content covered in the masters proposal as well as an additional 2 chapters focused on population genetics modeling. (1) Olympia oyster pop gen with improved environmental covariates and (2) re-run of the same model with geoduck and different management scenarios between regions.

### Oly pop gen project development
* Meet with Eric Ward to scope out Olympia oyster and geoduck pop gen chapters. Have him review slides for committee meeting.

### Eastern oyster + OA lncRNAs chapter rough draft
* Complete full rough raft for review by Steven, committee, Yaamini, and Ariana.

# January (CICOES Fellowship)

### Committee meeting
* Obtain feedback on research plan and bypass timeline. Float the idea of adding Eric Ward or Mark Schurell to committee for stats experience.

### Schedule bypass meeting
* Will need to be by May 15.

### Olympia Oyster Work with Mac
* Devote most of research time to NOAA/PSRF Oly pop gen work and getting in touch with Julieta Martinelli and Ryan Crim. Basically continue working with Evelyn.

### NW CASC Fellowship App
* Revisit prior year's application and get feedback from Eric Ward.

### Eastern oyster + OA lncRNAs chapter final draft
* Incorporate edits and prepare for publication.

# February (CICOES Fellowship)

### Oly Pop Gen
* Determine full scope of publishable work for CICOES funding. Start incorporating specifics into 3rd chapter.

### Complete NW CASC Fellowship app
* Send to Steven and committee for feedback. Obtain letters of support from WDFW and/or PSRF. Have ready to submit by Feb/March deadline (not yet announced).

### Eastern oyster + OA lncRNAs chapter submit
* Submit manuscript for publication.

# March (CICOES Fellowship)

### Bypass Proposal
* Write up additional proposal content for last two chapters of proposal. And send to committee as soon as possible for feedback.

### Wrap up intensive quarter with NOAA/PSRF
* Solidify next steps and determine actionable work to include in a chapter.

### Bypass meeting scheduled
* Finalize bypass meeting date and time.

# April (FISH 497 TA)

### Bypass proposal and slides
* Incorporate bypass proposal feedback, finish application, and finalize slides for meeting.

### SAFS Research Grant Sequencing
* Submit LC-WGBS samples of oysters either from PSRF or Steven.

### Oly pop gen and modeling
* Create outline for chapter incorporating CICOES quarter work with planned Oly pop gen modeling.

# May (FISH 497 TA)

### Final bypass app meeting
* Present bypass package to committe and obtain signatures from all committe members to submit by May 15.

### Oly pop gen and modeling
* Have the model up and running on my own computing resources by the end of the month. Wrap any lingering pop gen analysis with existing pipelines.

### Tentatively schedule quals
* Check-in with committee to see if a week in August/September will work.

# June (FISH 497 TA/Sea Grant)

### Oly pop gen modeling time series
* Start time series analysis for relevant environmental parameters to be included in model. Meet with Eric Ward and Mark Schurell to make sure I have the correct pipelines.

### Finalize quals date and time
* Confirm date and timing with committee and collect recommended literature to review before exam.

### Quals prep
* Read read read

# July (Sea Grant)

### Crab team busy season
* Lots of time devoted to field support and data management

### Quals prep
* Read read read

# August (Sea Grant)

### Crab team busy season
* Lots of time devoted to field support and data management

### Quals prep and exam
* Read read read. Exam may be toward the end of this month.

# September (Sea Grant)

### Quals prep and exam
* Read read read. Exam may be sometime this month.

### Oly pop gen modeling time series
* Complete rough draft of time series analyses for review by Mark and Eric.

### Crab Team summer wrap up
* Wrap up full time summer work with Crab Team



# Background Activities

These are the tasks and activities I have not included in the overall timeline.

### E5 descriptive and expression
* Will continue working with group on lncRNA side of things to round out a chapter that examines lncRNA characteristics and expression patters. All work to be incorporated into exisiting E5 publication plans.

### AI in Bioinformatics and Environmental Data Science
* Applied for the NCEAS Environmental Data Science Summit focused on AI in February. Hoping to get more involved with Steven's AI work.

### WSG Crab Team Data Publictation and Analysis
* Helping crab team publish data. Scoping potential projects to see if there is anything available to me that is worthwhile. Meeting with Carolyn soon to discuss pop gen work.
