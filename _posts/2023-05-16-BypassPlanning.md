### Main Points
* Bypass application submission planned for the Autumn 23 quarter deadline (November 15th)
* The required chapter ready for submission to a journal will be from my lncRNA work
* I will submit an MS proposal over Summer 23, since this proposal is required for the bypass application
  * This will also help me with dissertation proposal progress
* Two of my chapters will focus on lncRNA discovery, characterization, differential expression (environmental sensitivity), and co-expression with mRNAs
* A third chapter could focus on using machine learning tools to classify and predict function of non-coding RNAs
* A fourth chapter could get me more involved with the epigenetic-energetic modeling piece of E5. I'm particularly interested in examining environmental data inputs to these models, as well as incorporating non-coding RNA inputs to inform modeled epigenetic responses.
