### Feb 1-2
* Environmental data science class, working with PostgreSQL for database management
  * Have to load the Lake Washington data file before class Friday
* Rescheduled qPCR with Grace for Friday
* Did an inventory and prep for qPCR run of HSC70 for my mussel chapter
  * Need to order more plates and caps
* Learning how to complete a differential expression analysis
  * chatGPT was actually really helpful for this
  * Will be doing a DEA on CEABiGR oyster data specifically for lncRNA, should         allow me to setup my own pipeline to use for coral work later on

### Feb 3
* Had a chat with Jill Ashey from the Putnam Lab about non-coding RNAs
  * Sounds like we have similar interests in moving away from DNA methylation to       look at other mechanisms of gene regulation
  * Should probably set up a monthly (if not more frequent) meeting
* Joined science hour briefly
* Environmental data science class, PostgresSQL database building
  * I'm intrigued by PostgresSQL data management, but it doesn't really seem           appropriate for my work (or really any work happening at the individual grad       student level), but it makes sense for larger scale environmental monitoring       work or for an organization
* Ran mussel HSC70 qPCR with Grace

### Feb 6
* Lab meeting: chapter 13 of The Disordered Cosmos
* Environmental data science class, discussion about metadata and the best ways to   store data about your data, couple of cool R packages...
  * [EML](https://docs.ropensci.org/EML/index.html)
  * [DataONE](https://github.com/DataONEorg/rdataone)
* Had coffee with Olivia, Celeste, and Gabi
* Went to SAFS Cafe
  * Need to follow up with some of the other grad students about which stats           classes they found most useful
* Chatted with an undergrad from the class I TA-ed last quarter, I think he might    be a good undergrad to have help out in the lab
* Did some coastal erosion lesson planning with Ariana and Rosalind, we're going to   meet with an MHS math teacher next Monday
* SAC meeting
  * We discussed the new CoEnv-wide mentoring program
  * Seems like a great opportunity for undergrads but not sure we have enough grad     students interested
  * It will be largely informal with the intention of not being too time intensive

### Feb 7
* Wrote a letter of rec for one of my students last quarter for NSF ETEP
  * Have a nice letter of rec template now
* Had a chat with Anna
* Had an issue with Github Desktop not opening, but was able to fix it with          [this](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/issues/14735) solution
