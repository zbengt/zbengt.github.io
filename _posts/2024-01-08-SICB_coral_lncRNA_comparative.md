## Next steps

Currently at a stage where we are comfortable with resulting lncRNAs. Next steps:

* Location with BEDtools
* Pull transcript IDs hits between species
* Pull hits for hits between species and reference RNAcentral ID to get actual annotation 
* Lit review for conserved region analysis
* Develop or find pipeline for comparing lncRNAs to known conserved regions across many species
* Develop or find pipeline for comparing sequences and finding conserved regions as opposed to full sequence similarity between 3 species
* Run conserved region analysis for similarity to known conserved regions
* Run conserved region analysis to identify conserved regions between the 3 coral species
* Expression histograms for lncRNAs in each species
* lncRNA WGCNA runs
* mRNA WGCNA runs
* Correlations between lncRNA and mRNA modules in each species
* Comparisons in expression patterns between species?
