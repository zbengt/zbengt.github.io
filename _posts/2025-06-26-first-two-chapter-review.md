TL;DR - I went through the current status of my first two chapters to get a status report of to-dos to complete rough drafts during the writing portion of today's hack-a-thon.

### E5 coral lncRNA ID and expression

Overall requires a lot more attention and writing

-   Need to integrate parts of this chapter that are already present in deep-dive and deep-dive-expression projects, including some of the writing I did in those manuscripts.

-   Must finish Pearson's correlations and finish summary and results figures. The analysis piece here is pretty straightforward, especially now that we have nailed down the final lncRNA ID pipeline.

-   Paperpile associated with this chapter appears relatively complete with all the sources necessary to move forward with writing.

### CEABiGR oyster lncRNA

-   Has almost all of the necessary parts to move forward with writing and generation of results figures.

-   Intro section has summarized information of associated papers, and there should be enough reference papers already found to write this section.

-   The primary missing analysis is co-expression and cross-species comparison. Co-expression should be relatively straightforward as Ariana and I went through appropriate settings for WGCNA for this data and/or I could mimic the Pearson's correlation framework from E5. Cross-species comparison should hopefully be a matter of blasting all identified species against one another.
