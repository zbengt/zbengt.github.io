## Context

The NSFB18W2 population shows:
- **High heterozygosity**
- **Low Fis**
- **Moderate LD-based Ne (1,716–1,880)**

All of these metrics were calculated from the **same genotype dataset**, yet seem to suggest slightly different population histories. At first glance, high heterozygosity and low Fis might suggest a **larger Ne**, so why is the LD-based Ne only moderate?

## Key Points

### 1. LD-based Ne is Sensitive to Short-Term Demography
- LD Ne reflects **recent (1–3 generation) effective size**, based on **non-random associations between loci** (linkage disequilibrium).
- It's especially sensitive to **rare allele frequencies** and **recent bottlenecks or structure**.
- LD can remain high after a recent bottleneck, **even if heterozygosity remains high**.

### 2. Heterozygosity and Fis Reflect Broader Patterns
- **Heterozygosity (H)** measures **allelic diversity** and is shaped over longer timescales.
- **Fis** reflects **inbreeding** and is often close to zero when mating is random or outcrossed.
- These metrics are less sensitive to **rare alleles or recent stochastic changes**.

### 3. Gene Flow and Admixture Effects
- If NSFB18W2 has **recent gene flow or admixture**, this:
  - Increases heterozygosity,
  - Decreases Fis (heterozygote excess),
  - But can **inflate LD**, reducing LD Ne estimates.

### 4. Substructure Can Confound LD Ne
- The **Wahlund effect** or hidden substructure:
  - May artificially lower LD Ne,
  - Even while **maintaining high H and low Fis**.

### 5. Shared Data ≠ Identical Signal
- Even when computed from the same dataset, these statistics:
  - Focus on **different dimensions** of genetic variation,
  - Respond to **different demographic events**,
  - And can appear mildly discordant without being contradictory.

## Conclusion

> NSFB18W2's combination of high heterozygosity, low Fis, and moderate LD-based Ne is **not surprising or contradictory**. These metrics capture **different aspects** of genetic and demographic history—even when drawn from the same dataset.

The moderate Ne estimate may reflect recent demographic constraints, fine-scale structure, or elevated LD from historical factors, while the high heterozygosity and low Fis reflect a well-mixed, diverse gene pool.
