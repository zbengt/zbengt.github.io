### Jan 4
* First day of environmental data science course (FISH 549), went over course expectations, overview, and data science principles
* Worked on first committee meeting slides â€“ used GSS lightning talk slides as a jumping off point. Mussel work is pretty easy and almost set for final analysis. Long non-coding RNA work is a little harder to nail down.
* Troubleshooting lab notebook (unsuccessful)

### Jan 5
* Lab meeting and pub-a-thon
* Met with Steven to discuss first committee meeting
  * Need to focus on the story and add some additional context, each chapter adds a      layer of complexity, should add additional info on bypass and additional chapter
* Finishing up first draft of committee meeting slides, send to Steven when complete
* Steven helped me fix lab notebook
